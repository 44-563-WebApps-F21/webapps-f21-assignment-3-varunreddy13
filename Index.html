    <h1> Varun Reddy Musku</h1>
    <h3>My Favourite place is Manali </h3> 

    <p>
    Manali is known for its shiny gompas or Buddhist monasteries.
    With the highest concentration of Tibetan refugees in the entire Kullu valley,
    it is famous for its Gadhan Thekchhokling Gompa, built in 1969.
    Manali is named after the <b>Sanātanī lawgiver Manu</b>  (see Manusmriti). 
    The Kullu Valley in which Manali is situated is often referred to as the <b>"Valley of the Gods".</b> 
    An old village in the town has an ancient temple dedicated to the sage Manu.
