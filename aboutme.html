        <h1>Superman</h1>
        <p>
            Superman was born on the planet Krypton. This planet is much bigger than Earth and therefore, has a greater gravitational force than Earth. ...
            Superman can perform such magnificent feats of strength because Earth's gravity doesn't affect him as much as Krypton's stronger gravity would.
